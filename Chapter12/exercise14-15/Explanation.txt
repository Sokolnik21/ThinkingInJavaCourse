After throwing "RuntimeException" exception:
  in ex. 14 program will break, because there is not defined handling procedure in which switch will be turned off (that is necessary after executing this section)
  in ex. 15 program won't break, because component that is responsible for that action is defined in "finally" section, so no matter what at the end switch will be turned off
