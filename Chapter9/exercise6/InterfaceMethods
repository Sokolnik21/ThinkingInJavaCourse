Every single method in interface is public.
It's easily to prove by creating class that implements some interface.
If You do this You cannot override interface method and set their
privilege more strict.
So to prove that every interface methods are public, You can change
methods in Exercise5.java from public to more strict, like protected.
If You do this, the compilator will say "no" and won't compile it.
